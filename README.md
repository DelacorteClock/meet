# EdgyEvents Application

The application will allow users to learn more about events in different regions. It will allow information about events to be revealed and hidden. It also will display charts to indicate how many events are coming in different cities. It will allow customisation of how many events to see and what city the events are in.

## How To Use

You must login with Google to access the events. You can then use the city search box to find a city for the events. You can also modify the event quantity. To expand extra details click the black button on the event. You may then view the description and go to Google calendar if you want.

## Technology

It is serverless and a progressive web application. It will use react. I plan to use serverless functions because they will help make the creation of the app more practical. Specifically they will eliminate the need for making and maintaining a server. This enables management of authorisation for the site to be transferred to AWS to do the work with it being a cloud service provider. The result of this will be generation of a token to allow users to see the event information from Google Calendar.
